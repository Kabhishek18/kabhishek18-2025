# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature will implement schema markup (structured data) for blog posts using JSON-LD format to improve search engine visibility and enable rich results display. The schema markup will provide search engines with detailed information about blog posts, authors, publication dates, and other metadata to enhance SEO performance and potentially increase click-through rates from search results.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a blog post is rendered THEN the system SHALL include JSON-LD schema markup in the HTML head section
2. WHEN schema markup is generated THEN it SHALL include Article schema type with required properties (headline, author, datePublished, dateModified)
3. WHEN schema markup is generated THEN it SHALL include author information with Person schema type
4. WHEN a blog post has an image THEN the schema markup SHALL include the image URL in the schema
5. WHEN a blog post has categories THEN the schema markup SHALL include them as keywords or articleSection

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a search engine crawler, I want to access structured data about blog posts, so that I can display rich results with enhanced information.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a blog post template is rendered THEN the system SHALL automatically generate appropriate schema markup
2. WHEN blog post data is updated THEN the schema markup SHALL reflect the current information
3. WHEN schema markup is generated THEN it SHALL handle missing optional fields gracefully
4. WHEN multiple blog posts are displayed on a page THEN each SHALL have its own schema markup
5. WHEN schema markup generation fails THEN it SHALL not break the page rendering

### Requirement 4

#### Acceptance Criteria

2. WHEN schema markup is generated THEN it SHALL include all required properties for Article schema
3. WHEN schema markup validation is performed THEN it SHALL pass without critical errors
4. WHEN schema markup is implemented THEN it SHALL be visible in the page source for verification
