# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature will enhance the existing LinkedIn auto-posting functionality to include images with LinkedIn posts. Currently, the system can create text-based LinkedIn posts from blog content, but images are missing from both the LinkedIn posts and the link previews. This enhancement will integrate featured images and media content from blog posts into LinkedIn posts, improving engagement and visual appeal.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a blog owner, I want my LinkedIn posts to include images from my blog posts, so that the posts are more visually appealing and generate higher engagement.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a blog post is posted to LinkedIn THEN the system SHALL include the featured image if available
2. WHEN a blog post has no featured image THEN the system SHALL use the first available media image
3. WHEN a blog post has a social_image field THEN the system SHALL prioritize it over featured_image for LinkedIn posting
4. WHEN an image is included in a LinkedIn post THEN it SHALL be properly formatted and sized for LinkedIn requirements
5. WHEN image upload fails THEN the system SHALL still post the text content and log the image failure

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a LinkedIn user viewing shared blog posts, I want to see preview images in the link, so that I can quickly understand the content before clicking.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a blog post URL is shared on LinkedIn THEN LinkedIn SHALL display a rich preview with image
2. WHEN LinkedIn crawls the blog post URL THEN it SHALL find appropriate Open Graph image tags
3. WHEN no specific social image is set THEN the system SHALL use the featured image for Open Graph tags
4. WHEN multiple images are available THEN the system SHALL select the most appropriate one for social sharing
5. WHEN image dimensions don't meet LinkedIn requirements THEN the system SHALL provide fallback options

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the image integration to work seamlessly with the existing LinkedIn posting system, so that no manual intervention is required.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the LinkedIn posting process runs THEN it SHALL automatically detect and include appropriate images
2. WHEN image processing fails THEN the system SHALL continue with text-only posting
3. WHEN images are processed THEN they SHALL be validated for LinkedIn compatibility
4. WHEN the system posts to LinkedIn THEN it SHALL handle both single images and image carousels if supported
5. WHEN image URLs are generated THEN they SHALL be absolute URLs accessible to LinkedIn

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to monitor and troubleshoot image-related posting issues, so that I can ensure reliable LinkedIn integration.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN image processing occurs THEN the system SHALL log detailed information about image handling
2. WHEN image upload to LinkedIn fails THEN the system SHALL log specific error details
3. WHEN images are successfully posted THEN the system SHALL record the LinkedIn media IDs
4. WHEN troubleshooting is needed THEN logs SHALL provide sufficient information to identify issues
5. WHEN image processing errors occur THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages and suggested fixes
