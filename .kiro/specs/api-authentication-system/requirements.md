# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature will create a comprehensive API authentication system that provides secure access to all application URLs (except admin) for external applications. The system will include client ID management, time-based encryption key generation, and role-based authentication for CRUD operations on posts.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As an external application developer, I want to access all non-admin API endpoints, so that I can integrate with the blog system from my application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an external application makes a request to any non-admin endpoint THEN the system SHALL provide API access to all blog, core, and user endpoints
2. WHEN an external application requests available endpoints THEN the system SHALL return a list of all accessible API URLs excluding admin URLs
3. WHEN an external application accesses blog posts THEN the system SHALL return post data in JSON format
4. WHEN an external application accesses user data THEN the system SHALL return appropriate user information based on permissions

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As an external application, I want to authenticate before performing post operations, so that only authorized applications can create, update, or delete content.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an external application attempts to create a post THEN the system SHALL require valid authentication credentials
2. WHEN an external application attempts to update a post THEN the system SHALL verify authentication and ownership permissions
3. WHEN an external application attempts to delete a post THEN the system SHALL verify authentication and deletion permissions
4. WHEN an unauthenticated application attempts CRUD operations THEN the system SHALL return a 401 Unauthorized response
5. WHEN an authenticated application performs valid CRUD operations THEN the system SHALL execute the operation and return appropriate success response

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to generate time-expiring encryption keys for specific client IDs, so that I can control access duration and maintain security.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a new client ID is created THEN the system SHALL generate a unique encryption key with configurable expiration time
2. WHEN an encryption key expires THEN the system SHALL automatically invalidate the key and require regeneration
3. WHEN a client requests API access with an expired key THEN the system SHALL return a 401 Unauthorized response with key expiration message
4. WHEN an administrator regenerates an encryption key THEN the system SHALL create a new key with updated expiration time
5. WHEN a client uses a valid non-expired key THEN the system SHALL grant access to authorized endpoints

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to manage client IDs for different applications, so that I can control which applications have access to the API.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating a new client application THEN the system SHALL generate a unique client ID
2. WHEN a client ID is created THEN the system SHALL associate it with specific permissions and access levels
3. WHEN a client makes API requests THEN the system SHALL validate the client ID exists and is active
4. WHEN an invalid or inactive client ID is used THEN the system SHALL return a 403 Forbidden response
5. WHEN a client ID is deactivated THEN the system SHALL immediately revoke all associated access

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As an external application, I want to receive clear error messages and status codes, so that I can handle authentication and authorization failures appropriately.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN authentication fails THEN the system SHALL return HTTP 401 with descriptive error message
2. WHEN authorization fails THEN the system SHALL return HTTP 403 with permission details
3. WHEN an encryption key expires THEN the system SHALL return HTTP 401 with key expiration timestamp
4. WHEN rate limits are exceeded THEN the system SHALL return HTTP 429 with retry information
5. WHEN invalid client ID is provided THEN the system SHALL return HTTP 403 with client validation error

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to configure encryption key expiration times, so that I can set appropriate security policies for different client types.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuring a client ID THEN the system SHALL allow setting custom expiration duration for encryption keys
2. WHEN no expiration is specified THEN the system SHALL use a default expiration time of 24 hours
3. WHEN an encryption key approaches expiration THEN the system SHALL provide warning in API responses
4. WHEN multiple clients have different expiration needs THEN the system SHALL support per-client expiration configuration
5. WHEN expiration time is updated THEN the system SHALL apply changes to newly generated keys only
