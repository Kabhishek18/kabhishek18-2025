<h1>Introduction to Machine Learning</h1>
<p>Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that focuses on the development of algorithms and statistical models that enable computers to improve their performance on a specific task through experience.</p>

<h2>What is Machine Learning?</h2>
<p>Machine learning involves training algorithms on data to make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed for every scenario.</p>

<h3>Types of Machine Learning</h3>
<p>There are several types of machine learning approaches:</p>

<h4>Supervised Learning</h4>
<p>In supervised learning, algorithms learn from labeled training data to make predictions on new, unseen data.</p>

<h4>Unsupervised Learning</h4>
<p>Unsupervised learning finds hidden patterns in data without labeled examples.</p>

<h4>Reinforcement Learning</h4>
<p>Reinforcement learning involves training agents to make decisions through trial and error in an environment.</p>

<h2>Applications of Machine Learning</h2>
<p>Machine learning has numerous applications across various industries.</p>

<h3>Healthcare</h3>
<p>ML is used for medical diagnosis, drug discovery, and personalized treatment plans.</p>
